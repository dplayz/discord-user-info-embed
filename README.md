# Versioning
This project does not follow any versioning yet, but I'm planning to use Calendar Versioning

# Would I want this to be at the Lanyard Community Projects Lists?
I'm too hesitant for that because:
1. It has a very messy codebase
2. I'm simply shy enough lol
3. Still at alpha stage (I literally made the UI for just 1 day)
